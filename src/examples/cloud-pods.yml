  This example illustrates asynchronous LocalStack startup, to optimize the build time by running your test initialization tasks in parallel.

  The sample first uses the `localstack/start` command to start up LocalStack in the background,
  then performs custom application initialization commands (illustrated via the first `echo` command),
  and then finally uses the `localstack/wait` command before proceeding with the actual application build logic (second `echo` command).

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    localstack: localstack/platform@2.2

  jobs:
    localstack-test:
      executor: localstack/default
      steps:
        - localstack/startup
        - run:
            command: |
              awslocal s3 mb s3://test
              awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name=test-queue
        - localstack/cloud_pods:
            pod_name: circleci_test_pod

  workflows:
    localstack-test:
      jobs:
        - localstack-test
