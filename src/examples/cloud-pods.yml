  This example illustrates Cloud Pods usage with LocalStack to store the deployed infrastructure's state.

  The sample first uses the `localstack/startup` command to start up LocalStack in the background,
  then performs some infrastructure provisioning with awscli
  and then finally uses the `localstack/cloud-pods` command to store the state in a Cloud Pod.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    localstack: localstack/platform@2.2

  jobs:
    localstack-test:
      executor: localstack/default
      steps:
        - localstack/startup
        - run:
            command: |
              awslocal s3 mb s3://test
              awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name=test-queue
        - localstack/cloud_pods:
            pod_name: circleci_test_pod

  workflows:
    localstack-test:
      jobs:
        - localstack-test
