  This example runs a simple LocalStack build that manages S3 buckets and objects locally.

  The sample below uses the `awslocal` CLI command, a drop-in replacement of the `aws` CLI, for use with local APIs on `localhost`. The sample contains 2 steps: first, it starts up LocalStack via the `localstack/startup` command; second, it runs the commands to interact with the local S3 API provided by LocalStack.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    localstack: localstack/platform@latest

  jobs:
    localstack-test:
      executor: localstack/default
      steps:
        - localstack/startup
        - run:
            command: |
              awslocal s3 mb s3://test
              awslocal s3 ls
