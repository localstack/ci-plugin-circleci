  This example illustrates LocalStack's Ephemeral Instance usage.

  The sample first uses the `localstack/ephemeral` command to start up an ephemeral LocalStack instance,
  which in this case loads a previous state from a Cloud Pod,
  and then finally checks the expected resources already deployed in the state.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    localstack: localstack/platform@2.2

  jobs:
    localstack-test:
      executor: localstack/default
      steps:
        - localstack/ephemeral:
            auto_load_pod: circleci_test_pod
        - run:
            command: |
              echo "Running checks on my preloaded state..."
              awslocal sqs get-queue-url --queue-name=test-queue
              awslocal s3 ls s3://test

  workflows:
    localstack-test:
      jobs:
        - localstack-test
